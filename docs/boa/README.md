# BOA Guide (VCDesign Core)

This guide explains the shortest path to run VCDesign prompts with BOA.

## Quickstart
1. Load `prompts/boa_quickstart.prompt.md` into BOA.
2. Run the design session with `prompts/value-continuity-protocols_v1.0.md`.
3. Convert the session outcome with `prompts/vcdesign_to_testpack.prompt.md`.
4. Generate tests with `prompts/testpack_to_tests.prompt.md` if needed.

## Tips
- Focus on boundaries, responsibilities, and stop conditions.
- Keep a clear separation between facts and hypotheses.
